### Currently Searching for my First Job as a Junior Developer

I once thought it was a good idea to travel from Sydney to London without flying. As it turns out it's a really long way.

I'm looking for a Full Stack Junior Developer role where I can continue to learn everyday, within an fast paced organization that takes pride in its work and will challenge me to be my best.

## Profile

Iâ€™m a twenty-four year old Australian/Brit who has moved back to the UK after ten years in Australia. Up to this point, I studied Theoretical Physics at University, worked at a consultancy in Data Analytics and at the Houses of Parliament, climbed a few mountains, travelled from Sydney to London without flying, ran a wine cellar for two years and completed the Kokoda Trek in six days.

Since August 2016, I have been studying at Makers Academy, learning a whole host of new languages, methodologies and best practices. Having just graduated, I'm now looking to continue my journey with my first junior developer job.
